# Appendix 

## A - PL/SQL & SQL Coding Guidelines as PDF

These guidelines are primarily produced in [HTML](https://trivadis.github.io/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/) using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

However, we provide these guidelines also as [PDF](PLSQL-and-SQL-Coding-Guidelines.pdf) produced by [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

[![Trivadis PL/SQL & SQl Coding Guidelines in PDF format](../images/pdf-thumbnail.png)](PLSQL-and-SQL-Coding-Guidelines.pdf)

The formatting is not perfect, but it should be adequate for those who want to work with offline documents.
