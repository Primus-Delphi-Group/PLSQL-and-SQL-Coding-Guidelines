# G-1080: Avoid using the same expression on both sides of a relational comparison operator or a logical operator.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Efficiency, Testability

## Reason

Using the same value on either side of a binary operator is almost always a mistake. In the case of logical operators, it is either a copy/paste error and therefore a bug, or it is simply wasted code and should be simplified.

This rule ignores operators `+`, `*` and `||`, and expressions: `1=1`, `1<>1`, `1!=1`, `1~=1` and `1^=1`.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select emp.first_name
      ,emp.last_name
      ,emp.salary 
      ,emp.hire_date
  from employees emp
 where emp.salary > 3000 or emp.salary > 3000
 order by emp.last_name, emp.first_name;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select emp.first_name
      ,emp.last_name
      ,emp.salary 
      ,emp.hire_date
  from employees emp
 where emp.salary > 3000
 order by emp.last_name, emp.first_name;
```
