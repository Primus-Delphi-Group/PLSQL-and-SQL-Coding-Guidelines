# G-1060: Avoid storing ROWIDs or UROWIDs in database tables.

!!! warning "Major"
    Reliability

## Reason

It is an extremely dangerous practice to store `rowid`'s in a table, except for some very limited scenarios of runtime duration. Any manually explicit or system generated implicit table reorganization will reassign the row's `rowid` and break the data consistency.

Instead of using `rowid` for later reference to the original row one should use the primary key column(s).

## Example (bad)

``` sql
begin
   insert into employees_log (employee_id
                             ,last_name
                             ,first_name
                             ,rid)
   select employee_id 
         ,last_name
         ,first_name
         ,rowid
     from employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
begin
   insert into employees_log (employee_id
                             ,last_name
                             ,first_name)
   select employee_id 
         ,last_name
         ,first_name
     from employees;
end;
/
```
