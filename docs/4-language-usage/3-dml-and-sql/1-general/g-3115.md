# G-3115: Avoid self-assigning a column.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

There is normally no reason to assign a column to itself. It is either a redundant statement that should be removed, or it is a mistake where some other value was intended in the assignment.

One exception to this rule can be when you attempt to fire cross edition triggers when using Edition Based Redefinition.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
update employees
   set first_name = first_name;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
update employees
   set first_name = initcap(first_name);
```
