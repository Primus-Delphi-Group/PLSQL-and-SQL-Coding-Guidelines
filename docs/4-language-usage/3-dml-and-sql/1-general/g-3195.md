# G-3195: Always use wildcards in a LIKE clause.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

Using `like` without at least one wildcard (`%` or `_`) is unclear to a maintainer whether a wildcard is forgotten or it is meant as equality test. A common antipattern is also to forget that an underscore is a wildcard, so using `like` instead of equal can return unwanted rows. If the `char` datatype is involved, there is also the danger of `like` not using blank padded comparison where equal will. Depending on use case, you should either remember at least one wildcard or use normal equality operator.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select e.employee_id
      ,e.last_name
  from employees e
 where e.last_name like 'Smith';
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select e.employee_id
      ,e.last_name
  from employees e
 where e.last_name like 'Smith%';
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select e.employee_id
      ,e.last_name
  from employees e
 where e.last_name = 'Smith';
```
