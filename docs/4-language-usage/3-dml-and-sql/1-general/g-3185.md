# G-3185: Never use ROWNUM at the same query level as ORDER BY.

!!! warning "Major"
    Reliability, Testability

## Reason

The `rownum` pseudo-column is assigned before the `order by` clause is used, so using `rownum` on the same query level as `order by` will not assign numbers in the desired ordering. Instead you should move the `order by` into an inline view and use `rownum` in the outer query.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select first_name
      ,last_name
      ,salary 
      ,hire_date
      ,rownum as salary_rank
  from employees
 where rownum <= 5
 order by salary desc;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select first_name 
      ,last_name 
      ,salary 
      ,hire_date 
      ,rownum as salary_rank
  from (
   select first_name 
         ,last_name 
         ,salary 
         ,hire_date 
     from employees
    order by salary desc
       )
 where rownum <= 5;
```
