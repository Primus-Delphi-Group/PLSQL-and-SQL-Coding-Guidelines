# G-4120: Avoid using %NOTFOUND directly after the FETCH when working with BULK OPERATIONS and LIMIT clause. 

!!! danger "Critical"
    Reliability

## Reason

`%notfound` is set to `true` as soon as less than the number of rows defined by the `limit` clause has been read.

## Example (bad)

The employees table holds 107 rows. The example below will only show 100 rows as the cursor attribute `notfound` is set to true as soon as the number of rows to be fetched defined by the `limit` clause is not fulfilled anymore.

``` sql
declare
   cursor c_employees is 
      select *
        from employees
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employees_type is table of c_employees%rowtype;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch c_employees bulk collect into t_employees limit co_bulk_size;
      exit process_employees when c_employees%notfound;

      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
   end loop process_employees;

   close c_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (better)

This example will show all 107 rows but execute one fetch too much (12 instead of 11).

``` sql
declare
   cursor c_employees is 
      select *
        from employees
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employees_type is table of c_employees%rowtype;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch c_employees bulk collect into t_employees limit co_bulk_size;
      exit process_employees when t_employees.count() = 0;
      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
   end loop process_employees;
   
   close c_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

This example does the trick (11 fetches only to process all rows)

``` sql
declare
   cursor c_employees is 
      select *
        from employees
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employees_type is table of c_employees%rowtype;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch c_employees bulk collect into t_employees limit co_bulk_size;
      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
      exit process_employees when t_employees.count() <> co_bulk_size;
   end loop process_employees;
   
   close c_employees;
end;
/
```
