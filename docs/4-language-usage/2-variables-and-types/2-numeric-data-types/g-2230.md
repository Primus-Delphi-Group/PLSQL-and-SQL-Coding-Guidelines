# G-2230: Try to use SIMPLE_INTEGER datatype when appropriate. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency

## Restriction

ORACLE 11g or later

## Reason

`simple_integer` does no checks on numeric overflow, which results in better performance compared to the other numeric datatypes.

With ORACLE 11g, the new data type `simple_integer` has been introduced. It is a sub-type of `pls_integer` and covers the same range. The basic difference is that `simple_integer` is always `not null`.  When the value of the declared variable is never going to be null then you can declare it as `simple_integer`. Another major difference is that you will never face a numeric overflow using `simple_integer` as this data type wraps around without giving any error. `simple_integer` data type gives major performance boost over `pls_integer` when code is compiled in `native` mode, because arithmetic operations on `simple_integer` type are performed directly at the hardware level.


## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package body constants_up is
   co_big_increase constant number(5,0) := 1;
   
   function big_increase return number deterministic is
   begin
      return co_big_increase;
   end big_increase;
end constants_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package body constants_up is
   co_big_increase constant simple_integer := 1;
   
   function big_increase return simple_integer deterministic is
   begin
      return co_big_increase;
   end big_increase;
end constants_up;
/
