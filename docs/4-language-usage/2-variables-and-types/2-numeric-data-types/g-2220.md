# G-2220: Try to use PLS_INTEGER instead of NUMBER for arithmetic operations with integer values. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency

## Reason

`pls_integer` having a length of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, on a 32bit system.

There are many reasons to use `pls_integer` instead of `number`:

* `pls_integer` uses less memory
* `pls_integer` uses machine arithmetic, which is up to three times faster than library arithmetic, which is used by `number`.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package body constants_up is
   co_big_increase constant number(5,0) := 1;
   
   function big_increase return number is
   begin
      return co_big_increase;
   end big_increase;
end constants_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package body constants_up is
   co_big_increase constant pls_integer := 1;
   
   function big_increase return pls_integer is
   begin
      return co_big_increase;
   end big_increase;
end constants_up;
