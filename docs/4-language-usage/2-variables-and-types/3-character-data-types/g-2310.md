# G-2310: Avoid using CHAR data type.

!!! warning "Major"
    Reliability

## Reason

`char` is a fixed length data type, which should only be used when appropriate. `char` columns/variables are always filled to its specified lengths; this may lead to unwanted side effects and undesired results.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up 
is
   subtype description_type is char(200);
end types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up 
is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200 char);
end types_up;
/
```
