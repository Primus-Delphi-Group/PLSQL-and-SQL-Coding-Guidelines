# G-5010: Try to use a error/logging framework for your application.

!!! danger "Critical"
    Reliability, Reusability, Testability

!!! missing "Unsupported in PL/SQL Cop Validators"
    We cannot identify logging framework and where it should be applied. Requires further definition regarding naming of the error/logging framework and its minimal use in PL/SQL code.

## Reason

Having a framework to raise/handle/log your errors allows you to easily avoid duplicate application error numbers and having different error messages for the same type of error.

This kind of framework should include

* Logging (different channels like table, mail, file, etc. if needed)
* Error Raising
* Multilanguage support if needed
* Translate ORACLE error messages to a user friendly error text
* Error repository

## Example (bad)

``` sql
begin
   sys.dbms_output.put_line('START');
   -- some processing
   sys.dbms_output.put_line('END');
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
declare 
  -- see https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger
  l_scope logger_logs.scope%type := 'DEMO';
begin
  logger.log('START', l_scope);
  -- some processing
  logger.log('END', l_scope);
end;
/
```
