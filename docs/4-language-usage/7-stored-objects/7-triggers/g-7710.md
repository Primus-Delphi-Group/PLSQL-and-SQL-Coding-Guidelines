# G-7710: Avoid cascading triggers.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Testability

## Reason

Having triggers that act on other tables in a way that causes triggers on that table to fire lead to obscure behavior. 

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update on departments for each row
begin
   insert into departments_hist (department_id
                                ,department_name
                                ,manager_id
                                ,location_id
                                ,modification_date) 
        values (:old.department_id
               ,:old.department_name
               ,:old.manager_id
               ,:old.location_id
               ,sysdate);
end;
/ 
create or replace trigger dept_hist_br_i
before insert on departments_hist for each row
begin
   insert into departments_log (department_id
                               ,department_name
                               ,modification_date) 
                        values (:new.department_id
                               ,:new.department_name
                               ,sysdate);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update on departments for each row
begin
   insert into departments_hist (department_id
                                ,department_name
                                ,manager_id
                                ,location_id
                                ,modification_date) 
        values (:old.department_id
               ,:old.department_name
               ,:old.manager_id
               ,:old.location_id
               ,sysdate);

   insert into departments_log (department_id
                               ,department_name
                               ,modification_date) 
                        values (:old.department_id
                               ,:old.department_name
                               ,sysdate);

end;
/
```
